=======

This simple Leaflet app allows you to randomly place a specified number of waypoint drones on a map. You can then drag-and-drop a (draggable) mission drone on to the map, which will display D3 lines of varying color between the mission and waypoint drones. These lines are a dynamic indication of a somewhat arbitrary prioritization of distances between mission and waypoint drones, but could be used for more specific visualization such as an indicatation of prioritized waypoint navigation or of remaining battery life for a drone navigating through waypoints.
