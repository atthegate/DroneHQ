DroneHQ
=======

This simple Leaflet app allows you to randomly place a specified number
of waypoint drones on a map. You can then drag-and-drop a (draggable)
mission drone on to the map, which will display D3 lines of varying
color between the mission and way point drones. These lines are a dynamic
indication of a somewhat arbitrary prioritization of distances between
mission and waypoint drones.
